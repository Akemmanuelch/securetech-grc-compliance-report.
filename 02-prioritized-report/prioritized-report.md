# Prioritized Compliance Gaps – SecureTech Solutions

## Overview

An internal audit conducted at SecureTech has identified four compliance gaps related to ISO 27001 standards. Each finding has been analyzed based on its risk level and urgency. This document prioritizes the issues and outlines necessary remediation steps.

---

## Gap 1: Access Control  
**Priority Level:** Immediate  
**Issue:** Employees are using shared user IDs.  
**Risk:** High – Violates accountability and traceability, allowing actions to go unattributed during incidents.  
**Recommendation:**  
- Immediately eliminate shared accounts.  
- Enforce unique user IDs across all systems.  
- Update onboarding protocols to ensure compliance.

---

## Gap 2: Incident Logging  
**Priority Level:** High  
**Issue:** The system fails to log critical events (e.g., failed logins, data access).  
**Risk:** High – Limits breach detection and response time, increasing potential damage.  
**Recommendation:**  
- Upgrade or reconfigure logging infrastructure.  
- Define event thresholds and alert triggers.  
- Align logging practices with ISO 27001 standards.

## Gap 3: Physical Security  
**Priority Level:** Medium  
**Issue:** Employees bypass badge scanners to access restricted areas.  
**Risk:** Moderate – Enables unauthorized physical access but is localized and not systemic.  
**Recommendation:**  
- Place signage reinforcing badge use.  
- Conduct random access checks.  
- Reconfigure badge systems where needed.

---

## Gap 4: Policy Updates  
**Priority Level:** Low  
**Issue:** Information Security Policy hasn’t been reviewed in over a year.  
**Risk:** Low – A compliance issue with limited short-term operational impact.  
**Recommendation:**  
- Schedule annual policy reviews.  
- Complete a revision this quarter to regain compliance.

## Summary

This report prioritizes ISO 27001 compliance gaps based on potential risk and impact to SecureTech. Immediate focus should be placed on eliminating shared accounts and improving event logging. Physical access enforcement and policy updates should follow with structured, timely actions.
