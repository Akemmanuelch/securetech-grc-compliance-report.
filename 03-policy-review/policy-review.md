# Policy Review – SecureTech Information Security Policy

## Overview

As part of SecureTech’s ISO 27001 compliance efforts, a review of the Information Security Policy (ISP) was conducted. The review revealed that the policy has not been updated in over 12 months, which constitutes a compliance gap under ISO 27001’s documentation and continual improvement clauses.
