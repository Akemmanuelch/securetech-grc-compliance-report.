# Audit Findings – SecureTech (ISO 27001 Compliance Gaps)

## Overview
An internal audit conducted at SecureTech has identified four compliance gaps in relation to ISO 27001 standards. The findings include:

- **Access Control** – Employees are using shared user IDs, violating accountability and traceability requirements.
- **Incident Logging** – The current system fails to log critical events, such as failed login attempts and data access patterns.
- **Physical Security** – Some employees are bypassing badge scanners to access restricted areas.
- **Policy Updates** – The Information Security Policy has not been reviewed or updated in over a year.

## Prioritized Gaps

### Gap 1: Access Control
**Priority Level:** Immediate  
**Reason:** This poses a high-risk violation of ISO 27001. Shared user IDs eliminate user accountability, making it impossible to trace actions during security incidents. It leaves the organization vulnerable to internal misuse or undetected external breaches.

### Gap 2: Incident Logging
**Priority Level:** High  
**Reason:** Incomplete logging weakens breach detection and response capabilities. Missed failed login attempts and access anomalies may delay the discovery of an attack, increasing the damage window.

### Gap 3: Physical Security
**Priority Level:** Medium  
**Reason:** While concerning, this is localized and can be mitigated with employee reminders, security patrols, and reconfiguration of badge points. It doesn’t pose an immediate systems threat like Gaps 1 and 2.

### Gap 4: Policy Updates
**Priority Level:** Low  
**Reason:** While the policy being outdated is a compliance issue, its impact is indirect and manageable in the short term. A structured revision timeline can bring this back into alignment.

## Recommendations

### For Access Control (Highest Priority):
- Implement unique user IDs for every employee by the end of the quarter.
- Revoke shared IDs immediately and update onboarding protocols to prevent recurrence.

### For Incident Logging (High Priority):
- Initiate a system upgrade within 60 days to ensure all login attempts and data access events are properly captured.
- Coordinate with IT to define event thresholds and alert triggers.

### For Physical Security (Medium Priority):
- Post visible notices, remind employees of badge policy enforcement, and deploy periodic spot checks.
- Evaluate badge scanner placement to prevent bypassing.

### For Policy Updates (Low Priority):
- Schedule a formal review and update process to occur annually.
- Complete the current update within the next quarter to ensure ISO 27001 alignment.
